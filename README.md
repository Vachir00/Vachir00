## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineering student, tech enthusiatic and hardworker. I'm not working as developer, but I like to create things and, sometimes, I publish it.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as PS Consultant
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ & Golang (and English, that is a bit hard for me)
